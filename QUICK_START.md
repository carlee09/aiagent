## 📝 Tips for Interactive Mode

**Good Questions**:
- "What are the main concerns?"
- "Show me positive opinions only"
- "What do people say about [specific feature]?"
- "How has sentiment changed?"
- "What are the most discussed topics?"

**Special Commands**:
- `focus <topic>` - Deep dive on specific topic
- `sentiment` - Detailed sentiment breakdown
- `keywords` - All extracted keywords
- `sources` - Sources summary
- `help` - Show all commands

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Sentiment analysis shows "Unknown"
**Solution**: Data might not have enough text content. Try increasing `--max-items`.

### Issue: Keywords look strange
**Solution**: YAKE extracts n-grams, so some keywords might be 2-word phrases. This is normal.

### Issue: Interactive mode fails
**Solution**: Make sure your AI model API key is valid and has sufficient quota.

### Issue: Comparison fails
**Solution**: Ensure the previous report file exists and is a valid markdown file generated by this tool.
